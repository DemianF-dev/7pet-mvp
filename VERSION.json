  "releaseNotes": "Auto-generated from commit: fix: critical user division/role persistence bug\n\nPROBLEM:\n- User division and role were not persisting after save\n- Users would revert to CLIENTE division after page reload\n- Error message appeared: 'Email and password required for new users'\n\nROOT CAUSE:\nFrontend was unconditionally deleting customer object from payload,\nwhich could remove critical fields like division and role.\n\nSOLUTION:\n1. Frontend (useUserMutations.ts):\n   - Force include division and role in update payload\n   - Properly handle customer data (only include if exists)\n   - Added detailed logging for debugging\n\n2. Backend (managementController.ts):\n   - Added logging to track payload received\n   - Added logging before DB update\n   - Backend logic was already correct\n\nTESTING:\n- Edit user division from CLIENTE to MASTER\n- Save and reload page\n- Division should persist correctly\n- Check browser console for detailed logs"
